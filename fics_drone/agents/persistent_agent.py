"""Phase 5+6+7: one agent completes a search task with no preflight plan,
discovering targets by sensing, and now sharing what it finds with - and
learning from - teammates over an AgentLink. The lifecycle: observe (own
state + any delivered messages) -> update belief -> select objective ->
choose skill -> validate (Guardian) -> execute -> verify - repeated until the
policy returns DONE. Every objective is a response to a named event, never a
bare timer tick.

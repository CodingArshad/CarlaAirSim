"""Mission-level primitives on top of raw movement. Each wraps a non-blocking
adapter call in a polling loop with its own timeout, so a skill always
returns within a bounded time and always reports a real SkillResult, unlike
the raw actions in airsim_adapter.py which block on .join() with no limit.

Each function takes a VehicleAdapter, so these run against AirSimVehicleAdapter
or MockVehicleAdapter identically - nothing here imports airsim.

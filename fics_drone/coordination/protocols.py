"""One common envelope for every message, so ordering, expiry, addressing and
logging are implemented once, not per message type.

Scope note: FICS's own Phase 7 builds 13 message types. This build scopes
down to the two this mission's exit criterion actually needs -
TARGET_FOUND (the thing that has to propagate between agents) and HEARTBEAT
(exercises the TeamBelief/Provenance scaffolding Phase 6 built but left
dormant, since there was no second agent to have beliefs about yet). Task
bidding, role reassignment, and failure-recovery messages are real Phase 8-9
concerns, not invented early here.

"""One MissionTask per sector, and a per-agent TaskBoard - each agent keeps
its OWN local copy, updated only by messages it actually received, never by
reaching into another agent's board. That's what makes the version-conflict
bug FICS's own doc describes a real possibility here too, not something
designed away: two agents can each believe they won the same task if their
view of the bids differs.

version is a per-task Lamport clock (next = this task's own highest version
this agent has ever seen, +1), not a private per-agent counter - two
independent per-agent counters can both read "3" while meaning nothing in
common, which is exactly the bug FICS's own build hit and fixed.

    #   1. A drone must trust its OWN claim regardless of lease expiry - claimed_by()
    #      is lease-independent, for exactly this reason (an agent mid-sweep still
    #      considers itself the holder even if the lease clock is running low).
    #   2. Lease must exceed the longest skill (DEFAULT_LEASE_S=300.0 in
    #      task_allocator.py already satisfies this - the live build's longest
    #      measured sweep was ~218s).
    #   3. Health detection must be able to short-circuit the lease - waiting out a
    #      300s lease for a drone the team already knows is gone would mean most of
    #      the mission goes unsearched for no reason. release_if_failed() does this.

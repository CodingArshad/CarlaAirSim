"""The one place this codebase talks to AirSim, and the one place NED
(negative-up) gets converted to/from plain positive-up altitude.

ground_z is recorded once, at connect_and_takeoff() time, from wherever the
drone happens to be - so it must only ever be called once per real physical
takeoff. The caller (main.py) is responsible for that: connect_and_takeoff()
once per session, then execute() as many plans as needed without re-taking
off, landing only when the user actually says stop. Calling
connect_and_takeoff() again while still airborne would treat the current
altitude as ground level, and a later land() would disarm mid-air.

# AirSim's Python client (msgpack-rpc over Tornado) has a known concurrency bug:
# concurrent RPC calls against the SAME client instance from more than one
# thread can corrupt Tornado's own write buffer ("BufferError: Existing
# exports of data: object cannot be re-sized", or the same fault surfacing
# inside Tornado's own IOLoop callback thread). This repo already gives each
# vehicle its own client instance, but two separate threads still touch any
# one drone's client concurrently: that drone's own flight thread (moving it,
# polling its own arrival) AND the telemetry recorder thread (polling every
# drone's position on its own timer). That overlap is the actual race.
#
# First attempt used ONE lock shared across all 4 drones - that stopped the
# crash but wrecked responsiveness: every drone's poll loop now queued behind
# the other three's RPC round-trips on every single check, so a drone could
# sit well within its arrival tolerance for the full 30s skill timeout without
# ever getting a fast-enough speed reading to confirm it had settled. The
# actual conflict was never cross-drone - each drone's own client is only
# ever touched by ITS OWN flight thread plus the recorder thread, never by
# another drone's thread. A lock PER ADAPTER (see __init__) protects exactly
# that real overlap, with zero unrelated contention between drones.

# moveToPositionAsync()'s own timeout_sec parameter defaults to 3e38 - effectively
# unbounded - unless passed explicitly, which nothing here did. A live multi-drone
# run hung for over an hour: 3 of 4 drones landed fine, the 4th never returned,
# because all 4 land at the same tight spawn cluster and the last one back can find
# the landing zone already occupied by a parked drone. If noclip wasn't active, that
# collision means the move server-side NEVER reports completion, so an unbounded
# .join() blocks forever - no code-level logic can recover from that, only a real
# server-side timeout can. takeoffAsync/landAsync already default to sane timeouts
# (20s/60s); every moveToPositionAsync call below now gets one too.
MOVE_TIMEOUT_S = 30.0  # matches the skill-level timeout in control/navigation.py

# Even with the above fix, a live run still hung the same way - 3 drones landed, the 4th
# never returned. That proves the freeze isn't inside a move/land command at all: it's in
# getMultirotorState(), a PLAIN synchronous call AirSim's own API gives no timeout_sec
# parameter for at all. If that call itself never returns - the connection silently
# stalling, not the flight controller - the 30s skill-level timeout in control/skills.py
# never gets a chance to fire, because the polling loop is stuck INSIDE the call it's
# supposed to be timing, not at the point where it checks the clock.

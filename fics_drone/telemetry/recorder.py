"""Samples every drone's position on a fixed-rate timer, in a background
thread, for the duration of a mission run. The scorer needs a full path per
drone - final position alone can't catch a drone that clipped a no-fly zone
and was back outside it by the time the mission ended.

5 Hz default: at typical flight speed (5 m/s) that's one sample per metre of
travel, enough to catch a clip of anything wider than a couple of metres
without flooding the log or hammering a live AirSim connection with position
queries that compete against real flight commands.
